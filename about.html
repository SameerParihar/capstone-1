    <h1>About me</h1>
    <p>I am a dedicated and punctual student who wants to create solutions to various problems. I am starting my SDE journey with web development but i also want to dabble into app development, cloud and machine learning soon. Some positives about me are that i am very easy going and get along with others but still like to take work seriously and have a collaborative mindset. I also ensure that deadlines are always kept in check. I also like improving myself and overcome my shortcomings. </p>
    <p>Apart from academia, my hobbies are watching movies,series,anime etc., playing games, watching youtube. I also go for walks/jogs and dablle into home workouts from time to time. <p>
